        <hr>
        <p>For all parts of this project to run properly, it needs to be running in a server of some sort. This can be
            achieved by running it in a local server. Please run the whole directory (TMA1) in the server. </p>

        <p> If the server
            is running on <span>localhost:8000</span>, then please open this page by going to
            <span>localhost:8000/tma1.htm</span>, then all the links below will work properly to redirect you to the

        <h1 id="part1">Part 1: <span>XML Resume</span></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>This first project required us to create an xml version of our resume. There were 3 parts required:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>resume.xml - the resume itself as an xml</li>
            <li>resume.xsd - the schema of the resume</li>
            <li>resume.xsl - style sheet to display resume</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For this project, the first step was to create the schema that logically represented what you would expect to
            see in a resume. After the schema was done, I had to format my own resume to fit this new schema. Lastly,
            I created the style sheet to render the XML resume in a way that was easily readable and asthetic. </p>

        <p>To view the xml resume, click the button below. That will open up the xml document in a new tab, with the
            stylesheet applied. </p>

        <h1 id="part2">Part 2: <span>Educational Webpage</span></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The second project is a web application that can help someone learn web technologies that we have learned in
            the course. </p>

        <p>For this project, I had to decide on topics from Unit 1, 2 and 3 that I thought were fundamental, and figure
            out how to explain them in a way that was logical and made sense. In addition, after writing the tutorials,
            I had to come up with a quiz questions that tested the material well and showed that the user has understood
            the content correctly. </p>

        <p>Each unit's content is written in a seperate file, and the project uses AJAX to quickly switch between the
            selected unit without refreshing the whole page. The entrypoint for this project is
            <span>/part2/index.html</span>.</p>

        <p>To make the quizes easily editable and make it easy to add new ones, I decided to
            store the tests as XML files with the following format: </p>

        <div class="code wide">
            <p>
                &lt;quiz&gt; <br />
                &emsp;&lt;question&gt;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&lt;description&gt;Question text here&lt;/description&gt;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&lt;options&gt;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;option&gt;option 1&lt;/option&gt;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;option correct=&quot;true&quot;&gt;option 2&lt;/option&gt;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;option&gt;option 3&lt;/option&gt;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;&lt;option&gt;option 4&lt;/option&gt;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;&lt;/options&gt;<br />
                &emsp;&lt;/question&gt;<br />
                <br />
                &emsp;&lt;question&gt;<br />
                &emsp;&emsp;... <br /> <br />
                &lt;/quiz&gt;<br />
            </p>
        </div>

        <p>I then wrote javascript code that would automatically create the html content for
            the test from the XML file, by adding a custom <span>quiz</span> tag. </p>

        <div class="code wide">
            <p>
                &lt;quiz name="unitname" /&gt; <br />
            </p>
        </div>


        <p> The <span>name</span> attribute defines the name of the quiz. For example, the code above would look for a
            file called <span>unitname.xml</span> and create a quiz from it. This makes it easy to edit existing
            tests or create new ones since only
            the XML files need to be modified. </p>

        <p>All material for the lessons was adapted from the textbook: <br /><a

        <p>The third project was to create a slideshow web application. The slide show includes 20 pictures that I took,
            and allows users to start/stop the auto-play feature, and also allows setting different transition effects.

        <h1 id="part4">Part 4: <span>Utility Tools</span></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>For this project, we had to create a web application that has a variety of useful utility tools and
            calculators. The application will have the following 3 tools:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h2>Measurements converters</h2>
                <p>For this tool I created measurement converters for weight, length, area and volume, and used the
                    following formulas.</p>
                <div class="code wide">
                    <p>1 kilogram = 2.20462 pounds</p>
                    <p>1 meter = 3.28084 feet</p>
                    <p>1 square meter = 10.7639 square feet</p>
                    <p>1 cubic meter = 35.3147 cubic feet</p>
                </div>
            </li>

            <p>These formulas were taken from the Google unit converter. You can read more about it <a
                    href="https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/3284611?hl=en-CA#unitconverter">here.</a></p>

            <li>
                <h2>A mortgage calculator</h2>
                <p>This tool calculates the monthly mortgage payment for a loan given the amount, interest and period.
                    The formula I used was taken from thebalance.com, from <a
                        href="https://www.thebalance.com/calculate-mortgage-315668">this article.</a></p>
                <div class="code wide">
                    <p>a = starting loan amount <br />
                        n = number of payments <br />
                        i = periodic interest rate </p>
                    <p>D = {[(1 + i) ^n] - 1} / [i(1 + i)^n]</p>

                    <p>monthly payments = a/D</p>
                </div>
            </li>

            <li>
                <h2>Color picker</h2>
                <p>The last topic was a utility of our choosing. I decided to make a color picker that has a selector
                    and
                    displays the HEX and RGB values of the colors chosen. This is a very useful utility when creating
                    stylesheets since you can find out the hex code of the color you want for your web applications and
                    copy it
                    directly into your style sheet, instead of being limited to the pre-defined colors. </p>
            </li>

            <p>I read <a
                    href="https://www.developintelligence.com/blog/2017/02/rgb-to-hex-understanding-the-major-web-color-codes/">this
                    article</a> to learn about rgb and hex color representations and how to convert between them. </p>
            <p>I used a canvas to create the color picker using gradients. The <span>getImageData</span> function
                allowed me to get the RGB values, then I used <span>.toString(16)</span> to convert each value to
                hexadecimal. </p>
        </ul>
