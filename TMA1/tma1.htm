        <h1 id="part1">Part 1: <span>XML Resume</span></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>This first project required us to create an xml version of our resume. There were 3 parts required:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>resume.xml - the resume itself as an xml</li>
            <li>resume.xsd - the schema of the resume</li>
            <li>resume.xsl - style sheet to display resume</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For this project, the first step was to create the schema that logically represented what you would expect to
            see in a resume. After the schema was done, I had to format my own resume to fit this new schema. Lastly,
            I created the style sheet to render the XML resume in a way that was easily readable and asthetic. </p>

        <p>To view the xml resume, click the button below. That will open up the xml document in a new tab, with the
            stylesheet applied. </p>

        <h1 id="part2">Part 2: <span>Educational Webpage</span></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The second project is a web application that can help someone learn web technologies that we have learned in
            the course. </p>

        <p>For this project, I had to decide on topics from Unit 1, 2 and 3 that I thought were fundamental, and figure
            out how to explain them in a way that was logical and made sense. In addition, after writing the tutorials,
            I had to come up with a quiz questions that tested the material well and showed that the user has understood
            the content correctly. To make the quizes easily editable and make it easy to add new ones, I decided to
            store the tests as XML files, and wrote javascript code that would automatically create the html content for
            the test from the XML file. This makes it easy to edit existing tests or create new ones since only
            the XML files need to be modified. </p>

        <p>All material for the lessons was adapted from the official course textbook: </p>

        <p>I named my web based system: EzWebDev and it can be accessed by clicking on the button below. </p>

        <h1 id="part3">Part 3: <span>Slideshow Application</span></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>The third project was to create a slideshow web application. The slide show includes 20 pictures that I took,
            and allows users to start/stop the auto-play feature, and also allows setting different transition effects.
        </p>

        <p>The slideshow is displayed below using a frame.</p>

        <h1 id="part4">Part 4: <span>Utility Tools</span></h1>
        <hr>
        <p>For this project, we had to create a web application that has a variety of useful utility tools and
            calculators. The application will have the following 3 tools:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Measurements converters: weights, lengths, areas and volumes.</li>
            <li>A mortgage calculator</li>
            <li>A color picker *</li>
        </ul>

        <p>* The last topic was a utility of our choosing. I decided to make a color picker that has a selector and
            displays the HEX and RGBA values of the colors chosen. This is a very useful utility when creating
            stylesheets since you can find out the hex code of the color you want for your web applications and copy it
            directly into your style sheet. </p>
